Repository for all school projects in course AWE.

## Structure

For each language used there is one directory i.e. C++, C#, Java and Python. (Only I used Python for explaing other languages to myself)

## General Info

I visited this class beginning in September 2019 and my last class was in February 2022.\
There is really not much to say. Most projects are relatively simple and can be run out of the box. C# projects can be run by the .NET CLI. Python projects generally require the interpreter in version 3.7 or higher. C++ projects must be compiled and should work without much hustle anywhere. Java requires the JDK and the javac compiler.
